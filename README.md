# UX-Project-weddingly
This is a prototype of an app I created to address some of the difficulties that came with the concerns surrounding weddings, color codes, locations, invitations, gifting etc. It came up as an idea as my sister was getting married. I thought it would be cool to have some of these features centralized.


Title: Weddingly: A UX Case Study

Introduction/Overview: the current iteration of Weddingly is a mobile app designed to help couples invite guests to dream wedding. The app offers a range of features, including guest list management, seating, gifting features, venue, color scheme, and more. This UX case study will explore the process of designing Weddingly, from research and ideation to testing and iteration.

UX Design Process:

UX Research: To begin the design process, I conducted extensive research on the wedding industry, including trends, pain points, and user needs. I also conducted user interviews to gather feedback and insights from potential users of the app.

Design Process: Using the research findings, I began the design process by creating user personas, user flows, and wireframes. We then created high-fidelity mockups and a clickable prototype to test the app's usability and functionality.

Ideation Steps to Come Up with a Solution: During the ideation process, I focused on creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface that would allow couples to easily manage invitations. 

Test Solution and Iteration: I tested the app with a group of beta users and gathered feedback on their user experience. Based on their feedback, I made several iterations to improve the app's usability and functionality.

Next Steps and Learning: As I move forward with Weddingly, I plan to continue gathering feedback from users and making improvements to the app's design and functionality. I plan to create a second aspect of the app as the planner, not just for the invitation. I have learned that designing a successful wedding planning app requires a deep understanding of user needs and pain points, as well as a focus on creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface. By continuing to iterate and improve the app, I hope to create a valuable tool for couples planning their dream wedding.
