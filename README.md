# UX-Project-weddingly
This is a prototype of an app I created to address some of the difficulties that came with the concerns surrounding weddings, color codes, locations, invitations, gifting etc. It came up as an idea as my sister was getting married. I thought it would be cool to have some of these features centralized.
